  <h1>Scrum Express</h1>

  <p>
    We believe that there are a lot of factors to developing software well, but
    we work best when there is a well structured, defined process that still allows
    for agile flexibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    For most of our major custom software projects, we adopt a process we call <b>Scrum Express</b>.
    We started with the classic agile Scrum process and tweaked it over the years
    to only implement what we found most useful, throw out what we found unnecessary, and added
    our own features.
  </p>

  <h2>Development Sprint</h2>

  <p>
    Scrum Express centers around fixed chunks of development called Sprints. Our typical
    development sprint is depicted below.

  <h2>How this compares to classic Scrum</h2>

  <p>
    We call our process Scrum Express because we don't adhere to some of the stricter principles behind classic
    Scrum. Here are just a few of the things we DON'T use:

    <ul>
      <li>Formal User Stories</li>
      <li>Sprint Burndown Charts</li>
      <li>Definition of Done</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
