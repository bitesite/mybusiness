  <h1>Scrum Express</h1>

  <p>
    We believe that there are a lot of factors to developing software well, but
    we work best when there is a well structured, defined process that still allows
    for agile flexibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    For most of our major custom software projects, we adopt a process we call <b>Scrum Express</b>.
    We started with the classic agile Scrum process and tweaked it over the years
    to only implement what we found most useful, throw out what we found unnecessary, and added
    our own features.
  </p>

  <h2>Main Ideas</h2>

  <p>
    Coming Soon.
  </p>

  <h2>How this compares to classic Scrum</h2>

  <p>
    We call our process Scrum Express because we don't adhere to some of the stricter principles behind classic
    Scrum. Here are just a few of the things we DON'T use:

    <ul>
      <li>Formal User Stories</li>
      <li>Sprint Burndown Charts</li>
      <li>Definition of Done</li>
      <li>Product Owner</li>
      <li>Scrum Master</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

  <p>
    Scrum Express wasn't really designed. It was more of an evolution of an attempt to implement classic Scrum.
    Overtime we stopped trying to implement every rule of Scrum and accept that what we were doing and how we
    were modifying the process worked for us.
  </p>

  <p>
    That being said, Scrum Express is based on classic Scrum and a lot of its philosophies. A lot of this knowledge
    comes from a time way before Scrum Express was even called Scrum Express.
  </p>

  <p>
    As such, we would like to acknowledge those who kickstarted a lot of this knowledge:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Teldio</b> - A lot of our founder, Casey Li's knowledge of classic Scrum came from his
        days working at Teldio. There he was given the opportunity to learn about Scrum, run Sprints
        and work with the Teldio team to tweak and refine the process. A lot of what was learned there
        still carries on today in Scrum Express.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Agile Product Management with Scrum</b> - At Teldio, Casey Li was given a book by CEO at the time,
        David Black. This book became the foundation for a lot of the philosophy that drives the Product
        Management decisions in Scrum Express. It is a short but very informative book and a lot of
        its teachings are used in Scrum Express. We highly recommend reading it.

        <b>Our clients</b> - Our clients were and still are a huge part in helping us refine Scrum Express.
        They suggest new ideas and new processes and also give us the room to experiment and tweak this
        methodology.
