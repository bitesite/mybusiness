      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p>
        One of the main goals of our Software Development services is to give companies a kick-start - to give them all the tools they need to get some traction so that
        they can build a great software company. That's exactly what happened with Splice.
      </p>

      <p>
        Founders Norm Daigle and Serge Casault approached BiteSite with an ambitious app idea to build a web app to serve the independent consultant space. BiteSite aided
        in building the initial version exposing Splice to good software processes, technologies, philosophies, and more. Splice gained traction and was able to add their
        own resources to the mix to become a fully functioning software company.
      </p>

      <p>
        BiteSite maintains its relationship with Splice today helping more on the product management side.
