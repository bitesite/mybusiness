      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p>
        FileFacets is a market leader in the Information Governance space. Their solution allows their customers to handle millions of documents
        in an efficient and organized way. With a re-branding effort and new marketing strategy, CEO Chris Perram approached BiteSite to create
        a video that would easily explain their solution to potential customers.
      </p>


      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        With amazing collaboration with the FileFacets team and a clear vision, we were able to produce one of our best animated productions to date.
        The FileFacets team was very happy with the result and quickly featured it on their website.
