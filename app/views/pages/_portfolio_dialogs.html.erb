			Capo was one of our biggest projects yet. Capo is a Open Mic Community Web Application where players
			and audience members alike can find great live music. Users can find Open Stages, Filter by City,
			Submit Open Mics, Attend and See Who's Attending. Capo also featured a iPhone Optimized View.

			m&d was our first wedding website. It started out as a 'save the date' website, that eventually grew
			into a full blown web application with news updates, and a RSVP system that not only allowed guests
			to RSVP online, but also allowed the couple to view a summary of all the responses. m&d also featured
			a iPhone Optimized view to make it even easier for iPhone users.

			WWWP is currently a work in progress. It features our most minimalist design. It is a training website intended
			to change the way the world thinks about presentations. Aside from a simple elegant design, it features a solid
			back end with Content Management features, and Open ID Authentication (with Google IDs, Yahoo IDs and more). As mentioned,
			this is a work in progress that will have videos and other tutorials.

			a strong new web framework that Casey has learned and applies to the majority of BiteSites. caseyli.com was a resume
			website that allowed for Content Management to add and manage resume entires. It has now grown to host training videos
			and Casey's photography services as well.
